# Google-Sheets-Scripts
fun little projects to help organize life:

- Time Tracking Spreadsheet:
Light script that auto enters the time a task was finished.
Triggered by editing any cell in the bottom most row.



Wish To Do:
- make a ui for the time tracking sheet, to easier visualize time usage
- add auto date spliting, and detecting windows open to start tracking time right when open chrome
